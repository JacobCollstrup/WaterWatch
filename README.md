# WaterWatch

I build this web-app following along the course material here:
https://www.udemy.com/course/building-web-gis-apps-with-c-aspnet-core-mvc-and-leaflet/learn/lecture/30087974#overview
I would recommend this course to anyone interested in C# and GIS-systems.

It's a nice little project and I enjoyed it very much. Next step is to figure out how to get it up and running on heroku.
